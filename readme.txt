This is a p5.js sketch to generate and display subsets of a given input string that qualify as english words. I am using a file containing
every enlgish word to verify the permutations. The file is read in at runtime and a hash set created to reduce time complexity of checks.



todo:

  -add reset button, resets to just falling letters
  -get rid of fallingWords
  -show list of the words normally (small animation, maybe have the whole list grow in size and be able to scroll
  -make a wordlist object
